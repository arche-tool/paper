<h1 data-label="833026" class="ltx_title_section">Reconstruction algorithm</h1><div>The reconstruction algorithm consists of two major stages: 1)
calculation of existing orientation relationship and 2) clustering grains by parental relationship. The first stage generates input information
for the second stage. The use of the first stage is optional, as one
could input a theoretical OR or an OR measured/calculated from an external
source, but itâ€™s highly recommended as the precise definition of the OR
has a direct impact on the final outcome of the reconstruction procedure. The
proper value of the OR highlights the gap between grains coming from distinct
parents and narrows the distance between related grains.</div><div>Both stages have a pre-processing step to identify some microstructure
features. The two main features that are relevant for the reconstruction
algorithm are: grain boundary surfaces and grain volumes. Those features
are identified, respectively, as a set of discrete voxel faces and
discrete voxel volumes derived from the orientation grid provided by the
input ANG file (ANG is a standard file format which contains the basic data during an EBSD scan by OIM ).</div><h2 data-label="707851" class="ltx_title_subsection">Pre-processing</h2><div>Both OR calculation and phase reconstruction are based on the abstract
concept of graph formed by grains and their grain boundaries, as well as the
crystallographic orientation and misorientaion associated to each entity. The canonical
method to obtain such kind of information is through a crystallographic orientation scan (collected by e.g. the EBSD technique), which is -regardless of the format (e.g. ANG or CTF)- a simple grid of
discrete orientation points. Consequently,  a pre-processing step aiming to identify the
microstructure graph based on the input orientation map is necessary.</div><div>The algorithm starts by parsing the ANG file and converting it to a
rectangular grid (in case the input file is using a hexagonal grid), then
each measured point is converted into a voxel representation. A&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="179660">voxel</span> is
the volumetric atomic unit in the three-dimensional regular grid, therefore it
has regular positions that can be indexed and well defined surface
boundaries.</div>
