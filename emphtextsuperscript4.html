experimentally observed Orientation Relationship (OR) and another for
reconstructing prior austenite phase, are proposed. Both methods are
based on the angular deviation of the OR at the grain boundaries. The
first algorithm identifies the optimum OR using the misorientation
distribution of the entire scan i.e. without manual selection of parent
grains. The second algorithm reconstructs the parent phase using a
random walk clustering technique that identifies groups of closely
related grains based on their angular deviation of the OR.</div><div><b>Keywords</b> : steel, martensitic transformation, austenite,
