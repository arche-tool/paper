<div>The first iteration described above may result in some of the clusters
containing more than one parent grain because of the initial coarsening
level. These grains can be identified by their <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181271">higher</span> average angular
deviation, and therefore, they should be further refined by running an
extra iteration step with reduced coarsening level (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>c). The refinement
procedure should be repeated until all parent grains have low
average error.</div><h1 data-label="155612" class="ltx_title_section">Experimental procedure</h1><div>An Fe-29%Ni&nbsp; sample was used to validate the proposed reconstruction
method. The high nickel content  in this alloy decreases the starting temperature of the martensitic transformation (Ms) to below room-temperature. This  results in stable retained austenite in the microstructure after cooling from the solution  treatment temperature to room temperature.&nbsp; The EBSD analysis was used to fulfil the microstructural characterizationcharacterize of the microstructur was performed using a Quanta 450 FEI scanning electron microscope with&nbsp;field emission gun (FEG-SEM) equipped with EBSD&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>The initial material was a hot rolled fully recrystallzed&nbsp;</div><div>The OIM after the martensitic phase transformation with still

visible at twin boundaries in parent grains and some grains are over
refined. The current implementation of the reconstruction software is
quite simple and does not include any special rule for treating this
type of boundaries or for re-merging over-divided clusters.&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="947324" class="ltx_title_section">Validation and discussion</h1>
