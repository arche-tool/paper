method. The high nickel content  in this alloy decreases the starting temperature of the martensitic transformation (Ms) to below room-temperature. This  results in stable retained austenite in the microstructure after cooling from the solution  treatment temperature to room temperature.&nbsp; This austenitic microstructure will be used for the validation of the results of the reconstruction method. </div><div>The EBSD analysis was used to fulfil the microstructural characterization. To this purpose, a Quanta 450 FEI scanning electron microscope with&nbsp;field emission gun (FEG-SEM) equipped with TSL EBSD system was employed. The sample was prepared for the EBSD measurement according to the standard metallographic specimen preparation including grinding and polishing followed by electro-polishing. The EBSD measurement was carried out on an area of 1000x1000&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\mu\)</span>m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;with a step size of&nbsp;1&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\mu\)</span>m. To locate the EBSD scan area after phase transformation, micro-Vickers indentations were used to mark the area. After recording the microstructure of the initial sample, the phase transformation was performed by quenching the sample in liquid nitrogen.&nbsp; After quenching, the sample surface was gently polished to only reduce the surface relieves caused by the martensitic transformation, but to preserve the area for further characterization. The microstructure of the quenched sample was also investigated by the EBSD measurement performed on the same area and with the same parameters as for the  before quenching case.&nbsp;</div><div>The collected EBSD maps were further post-processed by the OIM analysis software which mainly included the clean-up of the raw data. During the clean-up procedure the "neighbour confidence index (CI) correlation algorithm" was employed in which all data points with a CI of less than 0.1 were replaced by the best neighbouring pixels. The post-processed EBSD maps were then exported as new files with  ANG  format which contains crystallographic orientation data as the Euler angles, spatial coordinate of the scan points, image quality, confidence index and phase ID values. </div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>&nbsp; shows the EBSD orientation map of the Fe-29%Ni sample  after quenching in liquid nitrogen (in other words,  after the martensitic phase transformation). As it can be seen, it exhibits a  martensitic microstructure w<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181771">ith 2% retained austenite</span>. The retained austenite grains have been marked by their phase boundaries which -according to Equation&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span>- were utilized for the optimized OR calculation.
