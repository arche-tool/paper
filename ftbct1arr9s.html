<div>The first iteration described above may result in some of the clusters
containing more than one parent grain because of the initial coarsening
level. These grains can be identified by its higher average angular
deviation, and therefore, they should be further refined by running an
extra iteration step with reduced coarsening level. The refinement
procedure should be repeated many times until all parent grains have low
average error.</div><h1 data-label="155612" class="ltx_title_section">Experimental procedure</h1><div>A Fe-Ni 29% sample was used to validate the proposed reconstruction
method. The OIM after the martensitic phase transformation with still
10% retained austenite is shown in the Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{188996}</span>-A. The expected parent
microstructure is visualized in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{188996}</span>-B by the retained austenite and
the traces of high angular deviation (&gt; 10Â°). Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{188996}</span>-C
shows the reconstruction after the first iteration, showing that some
reconstructed grains incorporate more than one parent grain. The final
microstructure is shown in figure 3d after an extra step of refinement.</div><div>A careful look at the figure 3d shows that some unexpected features are
visible at twin boundaries in parent grains and some grains are over
refined. The current implementation of the reconstruction software is
quite simple and does not include any special rule for treating this
type of boundaries or for re-merging over-divided clusters.</div><h1 data-label="947324" class="ltx_title_section">Validation and discussion</h1>
