<div>The first iteration described above may result in some of the clusters
containing more than one parent grain because of the initial coarsening
level. These grains can be identified by their <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181271">higher</span> average angular
deviation, and therefore, they should be further refined by running an
extra iteration step with reduced coarsening level (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>c). The refinement
procedure should be repeated until all parent grains have low
average error.</div><h1 data-label="155612" class="ltx_title_section">Experimental procedure</h1><div>A hot-rolled Fe-29%Ni sample was used to validate the proposed reconstruction
method. The high nickel content  in this alloy decreases the starting temperature of the martensitic transformation (Ms) to below room-temperature. This  results in stable retained austenite in the microstructure after cooling from the solution  treatment temperature to room temperature.&nbsp; The EBSD analysis was used to fulfil the microstructural characterization. To this purpose, a Quanta 450 FEI scanning electron microscope with&nbsp;field emission gun (FEG-SEM) equipped with TSL EBSD system was employed. The sample was prepared for the EBSD measurement according to the standard metallographic specimen preparation including grinding and polishing followed by electro-polishing. The EBSD measurement was carried out on an area of 1000x1000&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\mu\)</span>m<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;with a step size of&nbsp;1&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\mu\)</span>m. To locate the EBSD scan area after phase transformation, micro-Vickers indentations were used to mark the area. After recording the microstructure of the initial sample, the phase transformation was performed by quenching the sample in liquid nitrogen.&nbsp; After quenching, the sample surface was gently polished to only reduce the surface relieves caused by the martensitic transformation, but to preserve the area for further characterization. The microstructure of the quenched sample was also investigated by the EBSD measurement performed on the same area and with the same parameters as for the  before quenching case.&nbsp;</div><div>The collected EBSD maps were further post-processed by the OIM analysis software which mainly included the clean-up of the raw data. During the clean-up procedure the "neighbour confidence index (CI) correlation algorithm" was employed in which all data points with a CI of less than 0.1 were replaced by the best neighbouring pixels. The post-processed EBSD maps were then exported as new files with  ANG  format which contains crystallographic orientation data as the Euler angles, spatial coordinate of the scan points, image quality, confidence index and phase ID values. This ANG file served as the input of the reconstruction algorithm.</div><h1 data-label="947324" class="ltx_title_section">Validation and discussion</h1><div>Figure XX shows the EBSD orientation maps of the Fe-29%Ni sample before and after quenching in liquid nitrogen (in other words, before and after martensitic phase transformation). As it can be seen, the sample in the hot-rolled condition (i.e. before quenching) exhibits a fully recrystallized microstructure exclusively consists of austenite grains. There is also a high fraction of twin boundaries which is a commonly observed microstructural feature in austenite grains [ref]. As it was mentioned before, this austenitic microstructure was considered as the reference parent phase microstructure to examine the validity of the results obtained by the reconstruction algorithms. The microstructure of the sample after quenching in liquid nitrogen (cf. Figure XX.b) exhibits a  martensitic microstructure with &nbsp;implying that the phase transformation has been fully accomplished.&nbsp;</div>
