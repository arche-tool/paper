<div>Figure 1. </div><div>To Edgar! The optimized OR is something that I got from the
reconstruction software for the Fe-30Ni sample (perhaps it can be
improved). You can give me more accurate values then I will regenerate
this distribution. For this image I calculated this minimum
misorientation angle between K-S and the misorientation between the
inter-phase boundaries in the martensitic sample. the same thing for the
Optimum OR.</div>
