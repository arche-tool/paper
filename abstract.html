<div>Characterization of the austenite phase at high temperatures is important for understanding  the microstructural evolution during steel processing. The austenite phase can be reconstructed from the room-temperature microstructure based on the orientation relationship between the parent  and product phases. The actual orientation relationships in steels are often often based on the well-known correspondence relations (e.g. Kurdjumov-Sachs) which may differ from  the experimentally observed correspondences.&nbsp;This work introduces a new approach aiming to improve  the current state-of-the-art in prior phase reconstruction. It consists of two new methods, one to automatically identify the optimum orientation relationship and another one to reconstruct the parent phase microstructure. </div><div></div><div>using the  observed misorientation distribution of the entire EBSD scan. The  2nd one reconstructs the parent phase using a random walk clustering technique that identifies groups of closely related grains based on their angular deviation of the OR. </div><div></div><div>Archeâ€™s results were verified by experimental observations and were employed to characterize the parent austenite phase in additively manufactured maraging steel samples.</div>
