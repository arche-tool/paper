<div>Characterization of the austenite phase at high temperatures is important for understanding the microstructural evolution during steel processing. The austenite phase can be reconstructed from the room-temperature microstructure based on the orientation relationship between the parent and product phases. The actual orientation relationships in steels are often based on the well-known correspondence relations (e.g. Kurdjumov-Sachs) which may differ from the experimentally observed correspondences.&nbsp;This work introduces a new approach aiming to improve the current state-of-the-art in prior phase reconstruction. TwiArche comprises two new algorithms; the 1st one automatically identifies the optimum OR using the observed misorientation distribution of the entire EBSD scan. The 2nd one reconstructs the parent phase using a random walk clustering technique that identifies groups of closely related grains based on their angular deviation of the OR. Archeâ€™s results were verified by experimental observations and were employed to characterize the parent austenite phase in additively manufactured maraging steel samples.</div>
