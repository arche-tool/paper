<div>Characterization of the austenite phase at high temperatures is important Characterization of the austenite phase at high temperatures is important for understanding understanding the microstructural evolution during steel processing. The austenite phase can be reconstructed from the room-temperature microstructure based on the orientation relationship between the parent microstructural evolution during steel processing. The austenite phase can be reconstructed from the room-temperature microstructure based on the orientation relationship between the parent and product phases. The actual OR in steels product phases. The actual orientation relationships in steels are often often based on the well-known correspondence relations (e.g. Kurdjumov-Sachs) which may differ from well-known correspondence relations (e.g. Kurdjumov-Sachs) which may differ from the experimentally observed correspondences.&nbsp;This work introduces a new approach and software taiming to improve experimentally observed correspondences.&nbsp;This work introduces a new approach aiming to improve the current state-of-the-art in prior phase reconstruction. Arche comprises two new algorithms; the 1st one automatically current state-of-the-art in prior phase reconstruction. Two new methods, one to automatically identifies the optimum OR using the observed observed misorientation distribution of the entire EBSD scan. EBSD scan. The 2nd one 2nd one reconstructs the parent phase using a random walk clustering technique that identifies groups of closely related grains based on their angular deviation of the OR. Arche’s results were verified by experimental observations and were employed to characterize the parent austenite phase in additively manufactured maraging steel samples.OR.
