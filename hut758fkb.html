<div></div><div>The complete orientation map of the reconstructed parent austenite phase is presented in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>. Self-evidently, this microstructure is very similar to the experimental results shown in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a, both in terms of grain size/ morphology and crystallographic orientations. A unique aspect of the presented reconstruction method is that unlike the other alternative techniques (e.g. the ARPGE model based on the group properties of  ferrite variants of the same parent austenite developed by Cayron et al&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{cayron2007arpge}</cite>) which produces  a high number of unsolved points, the algorithm presented in this paper is  able to find a unique solution as parent phase orientation for every data  points of the product phase. The latter is a consequence of employing the&nbsp;Markov Clustering algorithm for the reconstruction purpose. A cross-correlation based approach was utilized to deterministically validate the reconstructed microstructure. To this purpose, the misorientation angle between corresponding data points in the experimentally obtained and the reconstructed microstructures (i.e. the m)</div>
