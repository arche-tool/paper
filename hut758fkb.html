<div></div><div>The complete orientation map of the reconstructed parent austenite phase is presented in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>. Self-evidently, this microstructure is very similar to the experimental results shown in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a, both in terms of grain size/ morphology and crystallographic orientations. A unique aspect of the presented reconstruction method is that unlike the other alternative techniques (e.g. the ARPGE model based on the group properties of  ferrite variants of the same parent austenite developed by Cayron et al&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{cayron2007arpge}</cite>) which produces  a high number of unsolved points, the algorithm presented in this paper is  able to find a unique solution as parent phase orientation for every data  points of the product phase. The latter is a consequence of employing the&nbsp;Markov Clustering algorithm for the reconstruction purpose. A cross-correlation based approach was utilized to deterministically validate the reconstructed microstructure. To this purpose, the misorientation angle between corresponding data points in the experimentally obtained and the reconstructed microstructures (i.e. the microstructures presented in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a and Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>, respectively) was calculated. It should be noted that in spite of the application of the micro-Vickers indentations to fix the EBSD scan area before and after quenching in liquid nitrogen, presence of some misalignments (horizontal and vertical shifts as well as sample rotation) between the two EBSD scans shown in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span> -and consequently between&nbsp;the microstructures presented in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a and Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>)- was inevitable. To minimize the error caused by this misalignment, a previously developed alignment algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pirgazi_2019}</cite> was used to meticulously align the two above mentioned microstructures before the  point-by-point misorientation angle calculation. The alignment technique was originally developed to align the two-dimensional EBSD sections obtained during a three-dimensional EBSD measurement accomplished by a serial sectioning approach&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{8511652,Pirgazi_2015}</cite>.&nbsp;<span class="au-background-red" data-background="true">Figure 10</span> shows the distribution of the minimum misorientation angle between the reconstructed and the reference microstructures.&nbsp;As it can  be seen, the distribution exclusively features  two peaks, one with the higher intensity at low misorientation angles (&lt;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(5^{\circ}\)</span>)  and the other one at around&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(60^{\circ}\)</span>. The appearance of the second peak is due to the  inefficiency of the algorithm to resolve some of the twin orientations in the  reconstructed austenite grains. The missing twins can be easily spotted by a  comparison between the microstructures presented in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a and Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>.
