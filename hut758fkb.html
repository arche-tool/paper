<div></div><div>The complete orientation map of the reconstructed parent austenite phase is presented in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span>. Self-evidently, this microstructure is very similar to the experimental results shown in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>a, both in terms of grain size/ morphology and crystallographic orientations. A unique aspect of the presented reconstruction method unlike the other alternative methods (e.g. the ARPGE model based on the group properties of  ferrite variants of the same parent austenite developed by Cayron et al) which produces  a high number of un-solvable points, the algorithm presented in this paper is  able to find a unique solution as parent phase orientation for every data  points of the product phase.</div>
