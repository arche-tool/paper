<div></div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{433657}</span> represent the  orientation maps of the reconstructed parent austenite phase and the experimentally obtained one. As it was mentioned before, this  austenitic microstructure was considered as the reference parent phase  microstructure to examine the validity of the results obtained by the  reconstruction algorithms. </div>
