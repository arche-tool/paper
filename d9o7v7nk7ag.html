<div>At every voxel face<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-X,+X,-Y,+Y,-Z,+Z\)</span>, the misorientation between itself and its neighbors are
calculated at the voxel faces:&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(-X,+X,-Y,+Y,-Z,+Z\)</span>. This can be
modeled as a graph where voxels are nodes and voxel face form edges
between nodes. The edge weight is given by misorientation angle.</div><div>By pruning edges with higher values of misorientation values (by default this value is set to 5Â°), the grains are simply defined as the set of voxels forming each connected graph network. Each grain can now receive a unique ID number (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(G_{id}\)</span>).</div><div>Grain boundaries are defined as the set voxel faces where&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(G_{id}^A\ne G_{id}^B\)</span> for the any neighbouring voxel <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(A\)</span>&nbsp; and <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(B\)</span>. The can be easily find by filtering the pruned edges from the previous step.</div><div></div>
