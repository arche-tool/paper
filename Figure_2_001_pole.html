<h1 data-label="528260" class="ltx_title_section">Parent phase reconstruction</h1><div>A new method, also based on grain boundary misorientations, is proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of closely related grains that were originated from a single parent grain. The applied OR can be one of the theoretical values (cf. Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:ORs}</span>), however, as it was shown before, the application of the optimized OR obtained during the first stage, will definitely increase the reliability of the reconstruction as it is expected to have maximum signal/noise ratio.&nbsp;</div><div>The selection of a suitable clustering algorithm has to take into consideration the characteristics of the reconstruction problem. For instance, no prior knowledge about the number of clusters (parent grains) is available, this eliminates a class of algorithms where such information is an input parameter. One of the most popular algorithms in that class is the k-means clustering approach&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hartigan_1979}</cite>. Moreover, due to the combination of measurement errors, lattice distortion during the phase transformation and the number of possible variants introduced by the orientation relationship, using a  threshold value and an algorithm to find connected graphs would result in an overly sized cluster containing multiple grains.&nbsp;</div><div>In this research, the Markov Clustering algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2000graph,schaeffer2007graph}</cite> was employed for parent phase reconstruction because of its noise tolerance and fast calculation time. Such an algorithm is based on the principle that the number of edges (and also their strength) within the cluster is higher than between cluster. And by randomly walking through the graph, the algorithm finds regions where the flow concentrates. The algorithm has basically a single parameter&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Gamma\)</span>, called inflation operator, that controls the granularity of the clusters. The minimum value of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Gamma\)</span> where the algorithm still converges is&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(1.2\)</span>. And as this value increases the&nbsp;Markov Clustering find partition cuts on areas that more closely connected, resulting in more finely grained clusters.</div><div>In order to use the clustering algorithm, a graph has to be derived from the OIM map in the following way: (a) each grain, product or parent, becomes a node in the graph, (b) each grain boundary becomes an edge connecting two neighbouring nodes (grains) and (c) each edge receives a value based on the &nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265" data-is-resolved="true"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265" data-is-resolved="true">Equations&nbsp;</span></span><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265" data-is-resolved="true"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:2}</span>, which determines the probability of the two neighbouring grains being products of the same parent (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>a).&nbsp; This is exactly the same graph created during the pre-processing phase with the OR applied to every edge (grain boundary misorientation).</div><div> Once the graph is constructed, the algorithm works by refining the clusters iteratively on a&nbsp; series of steps. At first step, the clusters are determined&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181268" data-is-resolved="true"> by setting&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Gamma\)</span></span> to&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(1.2
\)</span>, the lowest value,&nbsp; resulting in the&nbsp;highest level of coarsening (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>b). Then each cluster forms a parent grain and its orientation is calculated by an optimization algorithm that minimizes the average angular deviation using the&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181267"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181267">Equation&nbsp;</span></span><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181267">.</span></div><div></div>
