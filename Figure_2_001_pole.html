<h1 data-label="528260" class="ltx_title_section">Parent phase reconstruction</h1><div>A new method,&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181260">equally based&nbsp;</span>on grain boundary misorientations, is proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of closely related grains that were originated from a single parent grain. This is exactly the same graph created during the pre-processing phase with the OR applied to every edge (grain boundary misorientation). The applied OR can be one of the theoretical values (cf. Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:ORs}</span>), however, as it was shown before, the application of the optimized OR obtained during the first stage, will definitely increase the reliability of the reconstruction as it is expected to have maximum signal/noise ratio.&nbsp;</div><div>The selection of a suitable clustering algorithm has to take into consideration the characteristics of the reconstruction problem. For instance, no prior knowledge about the number of clusters (parent grains) is available, this eliminates a class of algorithms where such information is an input parameter. One of the most popular algorithms in that class is the k-means clustering approach&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Hartigan_1979}</cite>. Moreover, due to the combination of measurement errors, lattice distortion during the phase transformation and the number of possible variants introduced by the orientation relationship, using a  threshold value and an algorithm to find connected graphs would result in an overly sized cluster containing multiple grains.&nbsp;</div><div>In this research, the Markov Clustering algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2000graph,schaeffer2007graph}</cite> was employed for parent phase reconstruction because its noise tolerance and fast calculation time.</div><div>In order to use the clustering algorithm, a graph has to be derived from the OIM map in the following way: (a) each grain, product or parent, becomes a node in the graph, (b) each grain boundary becomes an edge connecting two neighbouring nodes (grains) and (c) each edge receives a value based on the &nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265">Equations&nbsp;</span></span><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181265"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:2}</span>, which determines the probability of the two neighbouring grains being products of the same parent (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>a).
