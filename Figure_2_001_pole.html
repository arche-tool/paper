<h1 data-label="528260" class="ltx_title_section">Parent phase reconstruction</h1><div>A new method, equally based on grain boundary misorientations, is proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of closely related grains that were originate from a single parent grain. This is exactly the same graph created during the pre-processing phase with the OR applied to every edge (grain boundary misorientation). The applied OR could  be one of the theoretical values in literature or from prior knowledge. But it's high recommended to use the optimized OR obtained on the first stage, as it is expected to have maximum signal/noise ratio.&nbsp;</div>
