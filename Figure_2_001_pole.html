<div>Figure 2. (001) pole figure of the commonly cited ORs (cf. Table 1) and
the orientation relationships optimized based on the GBs and average
orientations. The black dots in the right-hand side image are the
experimental data representing the misorientation across the inter-phase
boundaries.</div><div>To Edgar! The optimized-GB and -ave have been plotted based on some
axis/angle pairs which I got from the reconstruction software for the
Fe-30Ni sample (perhaps they are wrong). You can give me more accurate
values then I will regenerate these images. What I need is the
axis/angle pairs for Optimized-GB and Optimized-ave.</div><div>Parent phase reconstruction</div><div>A new method, equally based on grain boundary misorientations, is
proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this
method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of
closely related grains that originate from a single parent grain. The
Markov Clustering algorithm <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2000graph,schaeffer2007graph}</cite> is used because of the following
features:</div><ul><li>It is based on the probabilities of random walks through the graph.</li><li>It identifies natural cuts and clusters in the graph without the need
to specify threshold values of allowable angular deviations or the
necessity to specify a predefined number of clusters</li><li>There is only one parameter that controls the cluster coarsening.</li><li>Excellent noise tolerance.</li><li>Fast calculation time.</li></ul><div>In order to use the clustering algorithm, a graph has to be derived from
the OIM in the following way: (a) each grain, product or parent, becomes
a node in the graph, (b) each grain boundary becomes an edge connecting
two neighboring nodes (grains) and (c) each edge receives a value based
on the equation (1) or (2), which determines the probability of the two
neighboring grains being products of the same parent. Once the graph is
constructed, the clusters are determined using the highest level of
coarsening. Then each cluster forms a parent grain and its orientation
is calculated by an optimization algorithm that minimizes the average
angular deviation using the equation (1).</div>
