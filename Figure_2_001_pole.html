<h1 data-label="528260" class="ltx_title_section">Parent phase reconstruction</h1><div>A new method, equally based on grain boundary misorientations, is proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of closely related grains that were originate from a single parent grain. This is exactly the same graph created during the pre-processing phase with the OR applied to every edge (grain boundary misorientation). The applied OR could  be one of the theoretical values in literature or from prior knowledge. But it's high recommended to use the optimized OR obtained on the first stage, as it is expected to have maximum signal/noise ratio.&nbsp;</div><div>The selection of a suitable clustering algorithm has to take in consideration the characteristics of the reconstruction problem. For instance no prior knowledge about the number of cluster (parent grains) is made, this eliminates a class of algorithms where such an information is an input parameter. One of the most popular algorithm in that class in the k-means.&nbsp; Moreover, due the combination of measurement errors, lattice distortion from the phase transformation and increased symmetry introduced by the orientation relationship, using a  threshold value and algorithm to find connected graph would result in overly sized cluster containing multiple grain. </div><div>The Markov Clustering algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2000graph,schaeffer2007graph}</cite> was selected  because it fulfills </div>
