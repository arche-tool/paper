<h1 data-label="528260" class="ltx_title_section">Parent phase reconstruction</h1><div>A new method,&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181260">equally based&nbsp;</span>on grain boundary misorientations, is proposed for the parent phase reconstruction. The key concept of this method is the use of a graph clustering algorithm to find groups of closely related grains that were originated from a single parent grain. This is exactly the same graph created during the pre-processing phase with the OR applied to every edge (grain boundary misorientation). The applied OR can be one of the theoretical values (cf. Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:ORs}</span>), however, as it was shown before it's highly recommended to use the optimized OR obtained on the first stage, as it is expected to have maximum signal/noise ratio.&nbsp;</div><div>The selection of a suitable clustering algorithm has to take in consideration the characteristics of the reconstruction problem. For instance no prior knowledge about the number of cluster (parent grains) is made, this eliminates a class of algorithms where such an information is an input parameter. One of the most popular algorithm in that class in the k-means.&nbsp; Moreover, due the combination of measurement errors, lattice distortion from the phase transformation and increased symmetry introduced by the orientation relationship, using a  threshold value and algorithm to find connected graph would result in overly sized cluster containing multiple grain. </div><div>The Markov Clustering algorithm&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van2000graph,schaeffer2007graph}</cite> was selected  because it fulfils&nbsp;</div><ul><li>It is based on the probabilities of random walks through the graph.</li><li>It identifies natural cuts and clusters in the graph without the need to specify threshold values of allowable angular deviations or the necessity to specify a predefined number of clusters</li><li>There is only one parameter that controls the cluster coarsening.</li><li>Excellent noise tolerance.</li><li>Fast calculation time. </li></ul><div>In order to use the clustering algorithm, a graph has to be derived from the OIM in the following way: (a) each grain, product or parent, becomes a node in the graph, (b) each grain boundary becomes an edge connecting two neighbouring nodes (grains) and (c) each edge receives a value based on the equation (1) or (2), which determines the probability of the two neighbouring grains being products of the same parent. Once the graph is constructed, the clusters are determined using the highest level of coarsening. Then each cluster forms a parent grain and its orientation is calculated by an optimization algorithm that minimizes the average angular deviation using the equation (1).</div><div></div>
