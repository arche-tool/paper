<div>In the ideal case, when OR holds, angular deviation&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> is&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(0\)</span> on  Equations&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span> and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:2}</span>. Therefore one can find the best&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> value by 
minimizing&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> for the grain boundaries. In principle, only grain boundaries when OR holds (i.e. where both are derived form the same original grain) should be included in this calculation. Including other boundaries increase the error but since the number of grain boundaries exhibiting OR expected to be vastly larger than the number of prior parent grain
boundaries, the noise added can ignored. This is a reasonable assumption since the martensitic phase
transformation produces grain refinement and all the new grain
boundaries have misorientations that holds OR.</div><div>Although the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> value search could be performed without grain boundary selection</div><div>Two strategies were employed in order to calculate the grain boundary
misorientations. One is based on the average orientation of both
neighboring grains. The other one is based on the orientation in the
immediate vicinity of the grain boundary, where only the first layer of
orientations at each side of the grain boundary is selected. Slightly
different values of OR are obtained by the two strategies due to plastic
strain accommodation during phase transformation and associated
orientation gradients in bulk of the grains <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite>.</div><div>This new method was validated with a low Nb steel alloy with carbon
content around 0.05%. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{200480}</span> compares the distribution of angular
deviation using the theoretical KS OR and the optimized OR, it can be
noticed that the distribution shifts to the left, i.e. reducing the
overall error, when the optimized OR is used. Better results are
obtained when considering orientations in the immediate vicinity of the
grain boundary compared to considering grain averaged orientations.
Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>  compares the optimized OR for the low Nb sample with two
theoretical ORs and one reference value&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> that contains
comparable amount of carbon. The optimized OR is in good agreement with
the reference value.</div>
