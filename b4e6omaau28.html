Therefore one can find the best&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> value by 
minimizing&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> for the grain boundaries. In principle, only grain boundaries when OR holds (i.e. where both are derived form the same original grain) should be included in this calculation. Including other boundaries increase the error but since the number of grain boundaries exhibiting OR expected to be vastly larger than the number of prior parent grain
boundaries, the noise added can ignored. This is a reasonable assumption since the martensitic phase
transformation produces grain refinement and all the new grain
boundaries have misorientations that holds OR.</div><div>Although the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> value search could be performed without grain boundary selection (at cost of increased error), a simple technique can be easily applied. By taking advantage of the prior knowledge about the theoretical values of OR (e.g. K-S), one of them can be used evaluate the initial values of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>. Since the optimized&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> and the theoretical OR are expected to close (a few degrees deviation) the grain boundaries where OR holds should have&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> values near&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(0\)</span>. Therefore selecting boundaries with lower&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> values (current implementation defaults to&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(10^\circ\)</span>)  reduces the error on the calculation in a fully automated manner.</div><div>There are two alternative methods to calculate grain boundary
misorientations&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>. One is based on the average orientation of both
neighboring grains. The other one is based on the orientation in the
immediate vicinity of the grain boundary, where only the first layer of
voxels at each side of the grain boundary is selected. Slightly
different values of OR are obtained by the two strategies due to plastic
strain accommodation during phase transformation and associated
orientation gradients in bulk of the grains&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite>.</div><div>This new method was validated with Fe-Ni 29% allow. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{200480}</span> compares the distribution of angular
component of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> using the theoretical K-S  (also used to select boundaries and initial value to minimization search) and the optimized OR, it can be
noticed that the distribution shifts to the left for lower angular values, i.e. reducing the
overall error,  when the optimized OR is used. Also notice that the distribution shifts to right for higher angular values, resulting in a improved signal/noise relation and making it easier to distinct between boundaries under OR and prior boundaries. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{170946}</span> shows the improvement of the signal/noise ratio applied to microstructure grid.</div>
