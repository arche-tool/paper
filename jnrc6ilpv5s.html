<div></div><div>The OIM after the martensitic phase transformation with still 10% retained austenite is shown in the Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>-A. The expected parent microstructure is visualized in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>-B by the retained austenite and the traces of high angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(&gt; 10^\circ\)</span>). Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>-C shows the reconstruction after the first iteration, showing that some reconstructed grains incorporate more than one parent grain. The final microstructure is shown in Figure ???? after an extra step of refinement.</div>
