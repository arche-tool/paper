<h2 data-label="985346" class="ltx_title_subsection">Orientation relationship calculation</h2><div>As mentioned before, the presence of a specific orientation relationship between parent and product phases is one of the main characteristics of the martensitic transformation. Each parent phase reconstruction method  uses an OR as the input for its calculation, therefore, to achieve the best possible reconstruction  one has to provide an accurate OR value. Despite the proposed  theoretical ORs such as
K-S or N-W correspondences
for steels, a more accurate OR can only be derived from experimental
data. The available methods&nbsp;for OR identification&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{germain2007determination,miyamoto2009accurate}</cite>  depend on
the manual selection of parent grains, which is time-consuming and in
some cases, depending on the microstructure, impractical.</div><div>The proposed algorithm has an optional stage where it can derive the OR from the pre-processed microstructure graph in a
fully automated manner based only on the misorientation between
neighbouring grains. When analyzing the microstructure of a transformed sample, one can observe two kinds of grain boundaries. The first one is between a parent phase and product
phase grains, when still a residual fraction of the parent phase is present in
the transformed microstructure, and the second one is between product
phase grains. On both kinds, there is another level of differentiation but not observable directly on the microstructure graph (this is a task for the next stage i.e. the reconstruction algorithm). A grain boundary of the  first kind could be between a retained parent grain and a product grain produced by the same parent grain, in such a case the misorientation is expected to match&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T^{\alpha'\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span> after taking symmetry in consideration, as described in Equation&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span>. If the product grain is produced from a different parent, no assumption can be made about its misorientation. A similar differentiation also occurs in the second kind boundary, if two product grains are coming from different parents, as in the previous kind, nothing is assumed. However, if both product grains were derived from the same parent then they also hold an orientation relationship. But in this case, it is given by the <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181233">double relati</span> of the OR between parent and product grains (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T_m^{\alpha'\leftrightarrow\gamma}T_n^{\alpha'\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span>) as described by <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181266">E</span>quation&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:2}</span>, after taking symmetry in consideration.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
