<h2 data-label="985346" class="ltx_title_subsection">Orientation relationship calculation</h2><div>One of the main characteristics of martensitic transformations is the
presence of a specific OR between parent and product phases. Although
there are some theoretical orientation relationships proposed such as
the Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) or Nishiyama-Wassermann (N-W) correspondences
for steels, a more accurate OR can only be derived from experimental
data.</div><div>The parent phase reconstruction method described later uses the OR as input for its calculation therefore, to achieve the best reconstruction possible, one has provide an accurate OR value. The available methods&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{germain2007determination,miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> for OR identification depend on
the manual selection of parent grains, which is time consuming and in
some cases, depending on the microstructure, impractical.</div><div>The proposed algorithm has an optional stage where it can derive the OR from the pre-processed microstructure graph in a
fully automated manner based only on the misorientation between
neighboring grains. When analyzing a microstructure of transformed sample, one can observe two kinds of grain boundaries. The first one is between a parent phase and product
phase grains, when still a residual fraction of the parent phase is present in
the product microstructure. And the second one is between product
phase grains.</div><div>On both kinds, there is another level of differentiation but not observable directly on this microstructure graph (it is a task for the next stage, the reconstruction algorithm itself). For the first kind the boundary could be between a retained parent grain and a product grain produce by the same parent grain, in such a case the misorientation is expected to match the one of the. If the product grain is being produced from a different parent then no assumption can be made about its misorientation. A similar differentiation also occurs in the second kind boundary, if both product grains are coming from different parent, as in the previous kind, nothing is assumed. But if both product grains were derived from the same parent then they also hold a orientation relationship. But in this case, the  OR is given by the double product of the OR between parent and product grains.</div><div></div>
