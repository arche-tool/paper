<h2 data-label="985346" class="ltx_title_subsection">Orientation relationship calculation</h2><div>One of the main characteristics of martensitic transformations is the
presence of a specific OR between parent and product phases. Although
there are some theoretical orientation relationships proposed such as
the Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) or Nishiyama-Wassermann (N-W) correspondences
for steels, a more accurate OR can only be derived from experimental
data.</div><div>The parent phase reconstruction method described later uses the OR as input for its calculation therefore, to achieve the best reconstruction possible, one has provide an accurate OR value. The available methods&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{germain2007determination,miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> for OR identification depend on
the manual selection of parent grains, which is time consuming and in
some cases, depending on the microstructure, impractical.</div><div>The proposed algorithm has an optional stage where it can derive the OR from the pre-processed microstructure graph in a
fully automated manner based only on the misorientation between
neighboring grains. When analyzing a microstructure of transformed sample, one can observe two kinds of grain boundaries. The first one is between a parent phase and product
phase grains, when still a residual fraction of the parent phase is present in
the product microstructure. And the second one is between product
phase grains.</div><div>On both kinds, there is another level of differentiation but not observable directly on this microstructure graph (it is a task for the next stage, the reconstruction algorithm itself). For the first kind the boundary could be between a retained parent grain and a product grain produce by the same parent grain, in such a case the misorientation is expected to match the one of the ORs. If the product grain is being produced from a different parent then no assumption can be made about its misorientation. A similar differentiation happens for the second kind, if both product grains are derived from the same parent then the is spected to hold at the &nbsp; and&nbsp; sharing the same parent and involves a double OR transformation,
cf. (2). In the ideal conditions that the proposed OR is valid, the
angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta OR\)</span>) is equal to 0.</div><div>The algorithm finds the optimized OR transformation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(T_{\alpha^\prime\leftrightarrow\gamma}\)</span>) that
minimizes the average angular deviation for all grain boundaries or for
a selected subset of them. The number of grain boundaries exhibiting
this OR should be vastly larger than the number of prior parent grain
boundaries. This is a reasonable assumption since the martensitic phase
transformation produces grain refinement and all the new grain
boundaries have misorientations that obey the OR transformation.</div><div>Two strategies were employed in order to calculate the grain boundary
misorientations. One is based on the average orientation of both
neighboring grains. The other one is based on the orientation in the
immediate vicinity of the grain boundary, where only the first layer of
orientations at each side of the grain boundary is selected. Slightly
different values of OR are obtained by the two strategies due to plastic
strain accommodation during phase transformation and associated
orientation gradients in bulk of the grains <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite>.</div><div>This new method was validated with a low Nb steel alloy with carbon
content around 0.05%. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{200480}</span> compares the distribution of angular
deviation using the theoretical KS OR and the optimized OR, it can be
noticed that the distribution shifts to the left, i.e. reducing the
overall error, when the optimized OR is used. Better results are
obtained when considering orientations in the immediate vicinity of the
grain boundary compared to considering grain averaged orientations.
Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>  compares the optimized OR for the low Nb sample with two
theoretical ORs and one reference value&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> that contains
comparable amount of carbon. The optimized OR is in good agreement with
the reference value.</div>
