<div>Once the graph is constructed, the algorithm works by refining the clusters iteratively on a sequence of steps. At the first step, the clusters are determined&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181268" data-is-resolved="true"> by setting&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Gamma\)</span></span> to&nbsp;the lowest value (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(1.2

Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>b). Then each of the formed clusters becomes a candidate<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true"> for a</span> parent grain and a special procedure is applied to determine the mostly likely parent orientation and if the parent candidate is a good fit.</div><div> The process to determine the most likely parent orientation starts  by finding the Kernel Density Estimation on the &nbsp; placing the all possible parent orientation of a product grain in the cluster into a ODF space. They are calculated using all variants of the OR applied to Equation&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{eq:1}</span> with&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g = 0\)</span> and placed into the ODF with a Gaussian spread of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(5^{\circle}\)</span>, as shown the the simplified&nbsp;schematic with one dimensional ODF  on Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{747389}</span>a.&nbsp; The previous calculation happens to all product grains member of a cluster on the same ODF space (cf.
