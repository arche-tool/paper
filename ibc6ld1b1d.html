<div>Once the graph is constructed, the algorithm works by refining the clusters iteratively on a sequence of steps. At the first step, the clusters are determined&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181268" data-is-resolved="true"> by setting&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Gamma\)</span></span> to&nbsp;the lowest value (i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(1.2
\)</span>), resulting in the&nbsp;highest level of&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="182333">coarsening</span> (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{394885}</span>b). Then each of the formed clusters becomes a candidate<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true"> for a</span> parent grain. And on&nbsp;each parent grain candidate, the most likely parent orientation is calculated by finding the&nbsp;<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="182334">mode of the ODF</span> (Orientation Distribution Function) created by composing all possible parent orientation variants for each product grain orientation which belongs to the cluster.</div>
