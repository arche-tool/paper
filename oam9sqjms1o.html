<h1 data-label="947324" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181622">Validation</span> and discussion</h1><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{200480}</span> compares the distribution of angular component of&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span> using the theoretical K-S  and the optimized OR. Note that for the optimized OR, the K-S correspondence was used to select grain boundaries and initial value of OR to minimize the error and optimize the search procedure. It can be noticed that when the optimized OR is used, the distribution shifts to the left for lower angular values, i.e.  the overall error reduces. Also notice that the distribution shifts to right for higher angular values, resulting in an improved signal/noise relation and making it easier to distinct between boundaries following the OR and prior austenite boundaries. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{170946}</span> shows the improvement of the signal/noise ratio resulted from the utilization of the optimized OR applied to the microstructure grid of the Fe-29%Ni alloy.&nbsp;As it can be seen, by using the optimized OR the angular deviation for&nbsp; the majority of the GBs between the  product grains of the same parent reduces (i.e. the dominant green coloured GBs resulted from the K-S correspondence vs the dominant blue coloured GBs resulted from the optimized OR in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{170946}</span>).&nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp; replacement of the K-S by the optimized OR increases the angular deviation for the parent phase boundaries and makes them easier to distinguish.</div>
