<h1 data-label="947324" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true" data-comment-id="181622">Validation</span> and discussion</h1><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>a shows the results of the presented reconstruction method with an optimized OR based on the nearafter different cycles of iteration. These microstructures are  a subset of the reconstructed parent structure which correspond to the  marked areas  in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>. As it can be seen, after the first iteration, some reconstructed grains&nbsp;incorporate more than one parent grain. This can be also understood by taking the average angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>) for each reconstructed grain into consideration (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>b). High angular deviation of the large reconstructed austenite grains indicates the presence of more than one parent grain in the cluster. Only two steps of iterations is enough to quickly refine these grains into smaller austenite grains with sufficiently low angular deviations. However, the algorithm fails to reconstruct some small features of the microstructure (especially crystal twinnings) at this level of refinement (cf. the missed twins marked by arrows in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>a, step 3). A careful look at&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span> shows that further  iterations of refinement improves the reconstruction of some twins, although several thin twins are still missing in the microstructure. The reconstructed microstructures  do not significantly change after 7 steps of iterations, and as more iterations might lead to over-refined grains, this stage is considered as the optimum refinement and best reconstruction of austenite microstructure for the studied sample .&nbsp;</div><div>In an actual case, where no knowledge of the parent phase structure is available, the average angular deviation of the reconstructed grains can be employed to select the best number of refinement steps without the risk of over-division of clusters.&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{698603}</span> plots the changes of the average angular deviation after each step of refinement. As expected, the initial steps (1-3 iterations) significantly improved the angular deviation while the effect of the final steps (+8 iterations) is negligible. In this case, any number of refinement steps between 6 and 8 will similarly result in the best reconstruction.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
