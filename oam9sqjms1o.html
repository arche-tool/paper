These microstructures are  a subset of the reconstructed parent structure which correspond to the  marked areas  in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>. As it can be seen, after the first iteration, some reconstructed grains&nbsp;incorporate more than one parent grain. This can be also understood by taking the average angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>) for each reconstructed grain into consideration (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>b). High angular deviation of the large reconstructed austenite grains indicates the presence of more than one parent grain in the cluster. Further iterations quickly refines these grains into smaller austenite grain with significantly lower angular deviation. However,&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>-C shows the reconstruction after the first iteration, showing that some reconstructed grains incorporate more than one parent grain. The final microstructure is shown in Figure ???? after an extra step of refinement.</div>
