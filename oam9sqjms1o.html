Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>) after different cycles of iteration. These microstructures are  a subset of the reconstructed parent structure which correspond to the  marked area  in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>. The average angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>) for the reconstructed grains have been plotted in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>b. As it can be seen,  the first iteration results in  large austenite grains with relatively high i angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>) for each reconstructed grain into consideration (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>b). High angular deviation of the large reconstructed austenite grains indicates the presence of more than one parent grain in the cluster. Only two steps of iterations is enough to quickly refine these grains into smaller austenite grains with sufficiently low angular deviations. However, the algorithm fails to reconstruct some small features of the microstructure (especially crystal twinnings) at this level of refinement (cf. the missed microstructural features marked by arrows in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>a, step 3). A careful look at&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span> shows that further  iterations of refinement improves the reconstruction of most twins, although some thin twins are still missing in the microstructure. The reconstructed microstructure  does not significantly change after 7 steps of iterations, and as more iterations might result in over-refined grains, this stage is considered as the optimum refinement and best reconstruction of austenite microstructure for the studied sample.&nbsp;</div><div>In an actual case, where no knowledge of the parent phase structure is available, the average angular deviation of the reconstructed grains can be employed to select the best number of refinement steps without the risk of over-division of clusters.&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{698603}</span> plots the changes of the average angular deviation after each step of refinement. As expected, the initial steps (1-3 iterations) significantly improved the angular deviation while the effect of the final steps (+7 iterations) is negligible. In this case, any number of refinement steps between 5and 7will similarly result in the best reconstruction.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
