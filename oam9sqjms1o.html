Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>) after different cycles of iteration. These microstructures are  a subset of the reconstructed parent structure which correspond to the  marked area  in&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{406044}</span>. The average angular deviation (<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta g\)</span>) for the reconstructed grains have been plotted in Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span>b. As it can be seen,  the first iteration results in  large austenite grains with relatively high  angular deviation. The high angular deviation of a  reconstructed  grain indicates the presence of more than one parent grain in the cluster. Only two steps of iterations is enough to quickly refine these grains into smaller austenite grains with sufficiently low angular deviations. At this step, many delicate microstructural features such as crystal twinnings and small grains have been uncovered and are present in the microstructure.  A careful look at&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{460293}</span> shows that further  iterations of refinement slightly improves the angular deviation, however the reconstructed microstructure  does not significantly change after 7 steps of iterations, and as more iterations might result in over-refined grains, this stage is considered as the optimum refinement and best reconstruction of austenite microstructure for the studied sample.&nbsp;</div><div>Consequently, the average angular deviation of the reconstructed grains can be considered as appropriate parameter  to select the best number of refinement steps without the risk of over-division of clusters.&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{698603}</span> plots the changes of the average angular deviation after each step of refinement. As expected, the initial steps (1-3 iterations) significantly improved the angular deviation while the effect of the final steps (+7 iterations) is negligible. In this case, any number of refinement steps between 5and 7will similarly result in the best reconstruction.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
