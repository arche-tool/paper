<div>Identification of the orientation relationship in the microstructures
which contain both parent and product phases (e.g. austenite and
martensite) is straight-forward and can be calculated considering the
misorientation across the phase boundaries. However, this is not the
case for low alloyed carbon steels in which the martensitic
transformation is usually fully completed and the quenched
microstructure does not contain any residue of parent austenite at room
temperature. For this case, Miyamoto et al&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> proposed a method to
numerically determine the orientation relationship of lath martensite
and parent austenite based on the crystallographic orientation data
(obtained by EBSD analysis) of ferrite variants of the same parent
grain. In Miyamotoâ€™s method, a known OR (K-S or N-W) is first used to
roughly estimate the parent austenite orientation. The OR and the
estimated parent austenite orientation are then modified to minimize an
objective function representing the deviation between the recalculated
parent orientation for each variant and their average orientation.
Alternatively, Humbert et al  presented an analytical approach
to find the optimum orientation relationship using a sufficient number
of bcc variants. Their method searches for the best OR by minimizing the
spread of austenite orientations around their average orientation via
solving an optimization problem to maximize the norm of the sum of
quaternions for each variant.</div><div>This work introduces two new methods aiming to improve the
