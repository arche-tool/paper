<div>Identification of the orientation relationship in the microstructures
which contain both parent and product phases (e.g. austenite and
martensite) is straight-forward and can be calculated considering the
misorientation across the phase boundaries. However, this is not the
case for low alloyed carbon steels in which the martensitic
transformation is usually fully completed and the quenched
microstructure does not contain any residue of parent austenite at room
temperature. For this case, Miyamoto et al&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2009accurate}</cite> proposed a method to
numerically determine the orientation relationship of lath martensite
and parent austenite based on the crystallographic orientation data
(obtained by EBSD analysis) of ferrite variants of the same parent
grain. In Miyamotoâ€™s method, a known OR (K-S or N-W) is first used to
roughly estimate the parent austenite orientation. The OR and the
estimated parent austenite orientation are then modified to minimize an
objective function representing the deviation between the recalculated
parent orientation for each variant and their average orientation.
Alternatively, Humbert et al <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{humbert2011refinement}</cite> presented an analytical approach
to find the optimum orientation relationship using a sufficient number
of bcc variants. Their method searches for the best OR by minimizing the
spread of austenite orientations around their average orientation via
solving an optimization problem to maximize the norm of the sum of
quaternions for each variant.</div><div>When the OR is known, the parent phase orientation can be calculated by applying the OR as a transformation matrix on the product phase grains (i.e. ferrite grains). As it was mentioned earlier, due to the crystal symmetry several austenite orientations can be obtained for one single ferrite orientation. Converging to the unique solution requires simultaneous calculation of the austenite orientation for several neighboring ferrite variants (which are the product of the same parent grain). To this purpose, several methods have been presented and employed to calculate the unique orientation of parent austenite grains&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{miyamoto2010mapping,cayron2006groupoid,cayron2007arpge,cayron2006reconstruction,germain2012advanced}</cite>. Miyamoto et al.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Miyamoto_2010}</cite>&nbsp;proposed a method to locally reconstruct the parent austenite orientation by subdividing the orientation map into small squares. The best fitted austenite orientation which minimizes the average misorientation angle of all austenite orientations in that square is then calculated. Alternatively, Cayron&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{cayron2006groupoid,cayron2007arpge,cayron2006reconstruction}</cite>proposed a method based on the group properties between product variants of the same parent grain. In this groupoid structure based method, the nuclei of parent orientations are first calculated locally for a small set of ferrite variants. The entire austenite grains are then reconstructed by adding data points from neighboring grains. The latter is accomplished by relaxation of the crystallographic symmetry rule via tolerance angles of several degrees from the orientations of the nuclei. In a similar approach, Germain et al&nbsp;[<i>5</i>]&nbsp;showed that at least four ferrite variants (and not all possible ferrite variants) of the same parent grain are necessary to uniquely identify the nuclei of the parent austenite grains.&nbsp;</div><div>This work introduces two new methods aiming to improve the
current-state-of-the-art in prior austenite reconstruction.</div>
