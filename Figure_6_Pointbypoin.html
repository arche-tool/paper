<div></div><h1 data-label="219743" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion</h1><div>Tolerance error reduction and noise immunity are two fundamental
strategies for the success of prior austenite reconstruction. The use of
optimized ORs reduces the overall error but the identification by
previous techniques requires manual selection of parent grains. The
method proposed here identifies an optimized OR, whereby the entire
orientation scan is considered and the result is obtained without user
intervention.</div><div>Markov clustering seems a promising technique for parent grain
reconstruction due its noise tolerance and fast calculation time. The
present results are satisfactory considering the initial stage of
development and the simple implementation. Further work on the special
treatment of twin boundaries and cluster re-merging will be done.</div>
