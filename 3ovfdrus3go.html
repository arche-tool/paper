As it can be seen, the near-boundary algorithm provides by far the lowest  angular deviation  (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>(right)) while the average orientation approach exhibits similar characteristics to the K-S OR, both in terms of average angular deviation and the relationship between the closed packed planes/directions in parent and product phases (cf. Figure&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{657394}</span>(left)) .</div>
