<div>The selection of a suitable clustering algorithm has to take in consideration the characteristics of the reconstruction problem. For instance no prior knowledge about the number of cluster (parent grains) is made, this eliminates a class of algorithms where such an information is an input parameter. One of the most popular algorithm in that class in the k-means.&nbsp; Moreover, due the combination of measurement errors, lattice distortion from the phase transformation and increased symmetry introduced by the orientation relationship, using a  threshold value and algorithm to find connected graph would result in overly sized cluster containing multiple grain. </div>
