<div><b>1. Introduction</b></div><div>Microstructure is an important aspect of materials science, especially
of material characteristics and performance. The metallic microstructure
encompasses different constituents (e.g. defects, grain structure and
boundaries, phases, etc) that are present in a real metal product on a
length scale from millimeter to nanometer. There is a general consensus
that materials owe most of their functional and structural properties to
their chemical composition and microstructural features. The evolved
microstructure in metallic materials, on the other hand, is directly
related to their chemical composition and thermo-mechanical processing
parameters. For example, it has been shown that applying significant
cold rolling reduction to low carbon steels with mixed microstructure of
soft, low-carbon ferritic phase and hard, high-carbon martensitic
structure, followed by accelerated annealing results in homogeneous and
fine-grained microstructures with enhanced mechanical properties <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{petrov2013microstructure}</cite>. Therefore, study of microstructural evolution and
characterization of related features is a necessity for most materials
science related projects.</div><div>The evolution of microstructural features of metals and alloys processed
by different thermo-mechanical treatments has been extensively assessed
by employing various microscopic probing techniques (e.g. optical
microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM
respectively)) featuring resolutions that vary from a few microns to
less than 1 Å. Although these techniques successfully reveal different
microstructural features, they have been traditionally used for room
temperature studies. On the other hand, most metalworking processes are
performed at high temperatures (e.g. hot rolling) and the
microstructural features at room temperature are the products of the
high-temperature microstructure. For steels, the relation between final
microstructure and high-temperature microstructure is even more critical
not only because -for most steel grades- part of the steelmaking process
occurs at elevated temperature (i.e. the austenite (γ) phase), but also
because of the occurrence of phase transformation during cooling
. The products of the austenite transformation (i.e. ferrite (α),
bainite and martensite (α’)) inherit part of their properties from the
austenite phase [3], therefore characterization of the
high-temperature austenitic phase (aka the&nbsp;<i>parent austenite
phase</i> ) is of crucial importance to understand and control the
microstructure evolved during the steel processing operation.</div><div>Direct observation of the austenitic phase at high temperatures is not
easy as it can only be accomplished by employing very specialized
in-situ equipment like a hot stage equipped SEM [4]. Considering
that such in-situ measurements are carried out under simulated
laboratory conditions, they do not necessarily represent the
microstructures resulted from the actual process. An alternative
approach is to indirectly obtain the high-temperature microstructure
based on a room-temperature measurement, which can be fulfilled by two
techniques: (i) The prior austenite grain boundaries of a completed γ to
α’ transformation can be visualized in optical microscopy images by
special etching techniques [5]. (ii) The parent austenite structure
can be <i>reconstructed</i> from a digital image of the room-temperature
microstructure which contains crystallographic orientation data (i.e. an
Orientation Image Map (OIM) obtained by e.g. Electron Backscattering
Diffraction (EBSD) technique) [6–10]. The concept of the parent
phase reconstruction in steels -and other alloys featuring martensitic
transformation (e.g. titanium alloys [11,12])- is based on the
crystallographic correspondence (aka orientation relationship (OR))
between the parent and product phases. The presence of a specific OR
between parent and product phases implies that the parent phase
reconstruction techniques are applicable only to
displacive
or diffusionless phase transformations (e.g. martensitic transformation)
in which the crystallographic orientation of the product phase is
dependent on the parent phase.</div><div>The theory of the presence of OR in steels was first presented by Bain
[13], in which he justified the fcc to bcc phase transformation by a
rotation of 45° &lt;100&gt; accompanied by some
distortion -known as Bain strain- in the crystal lattice (i.e.
compression along the z axis and expansion along the other two axes). It
has been shown that Bain’s theoretical OR is more than 10° misoriented
with respect to the experimentally observed ones, i.e. K-S (Kurdjumov
and Sachs [14]), N-W (Nishiyama [15] and Wassermann [16]),
G-T (Greninger and Troiano [17]) and Pitsch [18] orientation
relationships. These ORs are typically presented either as pairs of
crystallographic planes and directions in the parent and product phases
which are parallel to each other (i.e. parallelism conditions) or as
axis-angle sets (cf. Table 1). It should be noted that due to the
presence of crystal symmetry, a specific number of symmetrically
equivalent planes and directions can fulfill the parallelism condition
which results in an explicit number of variants for each orientation
relationship (i.e. 24 variants for K-S and T-G, and 12 variants for N-W
and Pitsch ORs).</div><div>In practice, the application of these ORs for reconstruction of parent
phase microstructure faces two problems: (i) Depending on the chemical
composition, actual OR observed in a steel alloy shows a better fit with
one of the above-mentioned ORs, e.g. K-S OR has been frequently
confirmed by experimental observations in low-carbon steels [19],
while in Fe-Ni alloys, N-W crystallographic correspondence is closer to
the experimental results [20,21]. (ii) In contrast to the low index
rational planes and directions presented in Table 1, the measured ORs
are often irrational. Therefore, in order to perform reliable
calculations of parent phase microstructure and texture, a more accurate
description of the existing orientation relationship is required.</div><div>Table 1. different orientation
